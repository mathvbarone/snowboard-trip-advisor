## Enforcement status (auto-loaded at session start)

This repo enforces its rules with mechanical gates, not convention:

- CI required status check `quality-gate / qa` — runs `npm run qa`
  (lint → check:agent-discipline-sync → typecheck → coverage
  → tokens:check → test:hooks → test:integration) on every PR.
- CI required status check `dco` — verifies every commit carries a
  `Signed-off-by:` trailer. Missing trailer fails the PR.
- Pre-commit hook — `npm run qa` runs before every local commit.
- Prepare-commit-msg hook — auto-appends a DCO `Signed-off-by:`
  trailer when git identity is configured.
- PreToolUse:Bash hook — blocks `--no-verify` and `git push --force`
  (or `--force-with-lease` / `-f`) to `main`/`master`.
- PostToolUse:Edit|Write hook — lints the file just edited; violations
  surface in-loop so you can self-correct.
- CODEOWNERS — advisory in Phase 1; load-bearing paths still trigger
  the Subagent Review Discipline and maintainer review requests.
- AGENTS.md — canonical checked-in rules file for all agents.
- check:agent-discipline-sync — drift gate against AGENTS.md ↔
  CLAUDE.md pointer integrity and bot/ADR pairing.

Rule violations are reverted, not retroactively blessed. Read AGENTS.md
before starting work.

The current spec is docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-product-pivot-design.md.
Load-bearing decisions are recorded in docs/adr/.
